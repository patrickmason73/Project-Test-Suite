# Project Test Suite

This is a repository I created to test out concepts and new techniques that I learn.

The app is not meant for official use of any kind, simply a sandbox for myself to get some custom, hands-on experience with new concepts I pick up.

Frontend is built in ReactJS, backend is Ruby on Rails, and styling done via CSS stylesheets.
